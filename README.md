## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Integration

StudyDoc AI now supports MongoDB integration for storing user data, allowing for:

1. User authentication (registration and login)
2. Persistent storage of schedules and tasks
3. Saving study room configurations
4. Storing music preferences

### Setup Instructions

#### Quick Start with Mock Server

To quickly test the application with a mock authentication server (no actual database):

```bash
npm run mock-server
```

This will start a simple Express server on port 5000 that simulates user registration and login.

#### Full MongoDB Setup

For full functionality with MongoDB:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account or use a local MongoDB installation
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/studydoc
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

3. Install dependencies if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the MongoDB server:

```bash
npm run server
```

5. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run both together:

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

### Available API Endpoints

- `POST /api/users/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/users/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
- `PUT /api/users/schedules` - Save user schedules
